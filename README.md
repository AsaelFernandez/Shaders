# Shaders
Shaders created by my own using unity and URP
The ones I developed were:

## Potions Liquid (Fragment shader)
- This shader imitates the effect of potions in the bottles with customizable liquid level and being motion sensitive. They also shine and have random sparkles that imitates magic effect.

## Cauldron liquid animation (Vertex and fragment shader with VFX)
- This shader imitates a potion being prepared in a cauldron, with boiling depending on time, bubbles, particles, and waves intensity depending boiling.

## Smoke (VFX)
- Using vfx I developed a shader that imitates smoke, it deforms in the air and and intensity depending the amount of smoke in the same space.
